# 🐘 Serverless WordPress

This repository allows you to deploy a fully functional, lightweight WordPress instance on AWS Lambda using a custom runtime—no Docker, no EFS.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Build the Lambda Package

First, build your deployment package:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will produce `dist/lambda.zip` with WordPress core, `vendor/`, and `composer.*` files flattened into the root of the zip.

---

### 2. Deploy with Terraform

```bash
cd deploy/aws
terraform workspace select -or-create=true main
terraform apply -var-file=main.tfvars
```

Terraform will:
- Upload the built ZIP to S3 (if using `local_zip_path`)
- Create an IAM role
- Deploy a Lambda function using `provided.al2` (Bref currently requires al2)
- (Optionally) configure a Function URL and VPC networking

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Terraform >= 1.3
- Composer installed (for downloading bref dependencies)
- S3 bucket created and accessible
